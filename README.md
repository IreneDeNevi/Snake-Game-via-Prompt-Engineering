# 🐍 Snake Game — Built with ChatGPT & Python (via Pygame)

This is a classic Snake Game created as an experiment in prompt engineering using the free tier of ChatGPT, running entirely in Python with the help of Pygame.

The idea started from a simple question:

> *"I want to create a snake game using Python. What steps would I need to do that?"*

ChatGPT provided a complete plan, and after requesting the full implementation, this working game was born!  
🎉 Everything you see here is the result of that single conversation.

## 💡 How It Works

The game is built in Python using the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library.

- Control a green snake 🐍 using the arrow keys
- Eat red apples 🍎 to grow and score points
- Avoid crashing into walls or yourself — or it’s game over!
- Press `C` to restart, `Q` to quit

## 📁 Project Structure
```yaml
snake-game/
├── main.py             # The full game code (generated via ChatGPT)
├── first_prompt/
│   ├── prompt.txt      # The original prompt used
│   └── response.py     # The initial code ChatGPT generated
```

🌱 Why This Project?
This project was an experiment to:

1. Learn how to communicate effectively with an AI to build software

2. Explore how far a prompt + ChatGPT can go with minor editing

3. Create something fun with zero initial code

🙏 Thanks
Big thanks to:

* ChatGPT for being a patient coding partner 🧠

* Pygame for making game development in Python accessible

* Replit for a great place to quickly test and share
